Welcome to CloakForge, a new and growing comprehensive suite of cybersecurity and privacy tools. My mission is to provide privacy & anti-censorship solutions that protect your digital life and ensure your privacy in an increasingly censored internet.


I believe in empowering individuals and organizations with the tools they need to maintain their digital security and privacy. Every tool I develop is crafted with intent. These tools were forged to evade systems like DPI and VPN censorship. Everything is open-source for transparency.
