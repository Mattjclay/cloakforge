**Protect your privacy and defend yourself against network surveillance**

Tor Browser is a free and open-source web browser that enables anonymous communication by directing internet traffic through a worldwide network of servers. It protects users from traffic analysis and network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy.

The Tor network uses **onion routing** to encrypt and bounce communications through multiple relays:

1. **Entry Node** - Your traffic enters the Tor network
2. **Middle Relay** - Traffic bounces through multiple relays  
3. **Exit Node** - Traffic exits to reach destination
4. **Layered Encryption** - Each hop only knows the previous and next step

## Key Features

- **Anonymous Browsing** - Hide your IP address and location
- **Circumvent Censorship** - Access blocked websites and services
- **No Tracking** - Blocks trackers and prevents fingerprinting
- **Secure by Default** - HTTPS Everywhere and NoScript built-in
- **Cross-Platform** - Available on all major operating systems

## Privacy Protections

### Built-in Security Features
- **Traffic Encryption** - Multi-layer encryption through Tor network
- **Fingerprinting Protection** - Standardized browser fingerprint
- **Script Blocking** - NoScript prevents malicious JavaScript
- **Cookie Isolation** - Cookies cleared between sessions
- **DNS Protection** - DNS requests routed through Tor

### Security Levels
- **Standard** - Default security, all features enabled
- **Safer** - Disables some features that could be unsafe
- **Safest** - Maximum security, JavaScript disabled

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
